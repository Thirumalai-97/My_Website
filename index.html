We all know that we are already begun Quantum era. And I'm sure that we can't ignore the supermace of Quantum computer that going to dominate the world.
Most of us are so excited when we hear about quantum theories either from movies or youtube videos. Some popluar concepts like superposition, Entanglement, Teleportation, Tunneling and much more. 
You won't belive these are not just theories they already have a lot of real world applications. My objective is to make you much comfortable with Realm of Quantum. 
So yeah! let's dive in to Quantum world.  

For better convenience events, theories, laws, algorithms and much more happening in real world are figured as Classic or classical and if the same which happens are called as Quantum.

<h3>
    Superposition
    
</h3>
<p>
    We all encountered tosing coin problem in our high school. In Classical while tossing a coin we have two outcomes namely head and tail. So all the time we have either Head or Tail. But what if tell you in Quantum there is a probabity of coin being exist in both Head and Tail simulateously. Wondering right?, ya that's what we called as Superposition.
