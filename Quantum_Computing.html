     Single Qubit Gates
      </h5>  
      Classical computers manipulate bits using classical logic gates such as OR, AND, NOT and NAND. This linkFootnote provides a basic review of classical logic gates. Similarly, quantum computers manipulate qubits using quantum gates . The gates are applied to qubits and the states of the qubits change depending on which gate is applied. In the Bloch sphere representation, the gate provides instructions for rotating the qubit’s arrow around the sphere. A quantum algorithm has to be implemented on a quantum computer using quantum gates. After running a quantum algorithm, the result is retrieved by measuring the qubit’s state. The hardware implementation of quantum gates depends on how the qubit and quantum computer has been implemented technologically.Footnote2 As an example, one could have a qubit based on spin. Then gates could be implemented using an external magnetic field to change the spin and hence the qubit state. This chapter will focus on gates from the computing perspective rather than the engineering perspective. You will learn about several important gates that act on a single qubit, interpret histograms produced by a quantum computer simulator, and use matrices to describe the operation of these gates.

      <h5>
         X (Also Called NOT) Gate
      </h5>

      In classical computers, the NOT gate takes one input and reverses its value. For example, it changes the 0 bit to a 1 bit or changes a 1 bit to a 0 bit. This is like a light-switch flipping a light from ON to OFF, or from OFF to ON. A quantum X gate is similar in that a qubit in a definite state |0〉 will become |1〉 and vice versa. When the qubit is in a superposition of all basis states, then the superposition also flips:

      <h5>
          Hadamard Gate
      </h5>
`The Hadamard gate is very important in quantum computing. If the qubit starts in a definite |0〉 or |1〉 state, the Hadamard gate puts each into a superposition of |0〉 and |1〉 states

<h5>
    Z Gate
</h5>
The Z gate leaves a |0〉 state unchanged but flips the sign of the |1〉 state to −|1〉
