        <h2> Once Upon a time in Physics-The Birth of Quantum Physics</h2>  <hr>     
    </center>
    <p>I was first introduced to the world of quantum mechanics through popular media like Marvel movies and online videos. As I advanced in my higher education, I found myself increasingly fascinated by the fundamental principles of quantum physics. What I realized is that the actual facts and phenomena like Quantum Tunnelling, Quantum Teleportation, Quantum Algorithms, Quantum Machine Learning, Quantum Communication etc., within the realm of quantum mechanics are often more astonishing and mind-boggling than the speculations and mysteries that occasionally surround them. One captivating example of this is the intriguing concept of quantum teleportation.

        The concept of quantum mechanics has generated a significant amount of excitement among people from various backgrounds. Quantum is no longer confined to the realms of science fiction or specialised scientific knowledge. This article aims to introduce the origins of quantum mechanics in simpler terms, without delving too deeply into the complex physics. In the future, we will explore its practical applications and how it supersedes classical concepts in various fields.

        At the start of the 20th century, classical physics appeared to have comprehensively explained the laws of the physical world. However, there were still unresolved questions, such as those related to Black Body Radiation and the Photoelectric effect. Max Planck's work in 1900 in solving Black Body Radiation introduced the Planck constant, which marked the inception of quantum physics. In 1905, Einstein utilized this constant to define the Photoelectric effect, marking a major advancement in quantum physics. It was Einstein who introduced the term "Quanta." Both Einstein and Planck were subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize for their contributions to quantum mechanics.

        In 1913, Niels Bohr, often considered one of the Founding Fathers of Quantum Mechanics along with Max Planck, proposed a theory for the hydrogen atom based on the notion that certain physical quantities can only have discrete values. Electrons orbit nuclei in predefined orbits, and when electrons transition to lower-energy orbits, they emit radiation. In 1925, Louis de Broglie introduced a groundbreaking hypothesis, suggesting that particles, such as electrons, could be described not only as particles but also as waves, a crucial development in the quantum field.

        Two well-known physicists, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger, made significant contributions. Heisenberg's famous Uncertainty Principle stated that we cannot know both the position and speed of a particle with perfect accuracy. This principle forms the foundation for numerous quantum applications, including quantum information and quantum computation.

        Schrödinger's famous "cat" thought experiment helps us understand the concept of superposition, where a physical system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. This seemingly simple idea is fundamental to the allure of quantum computing and quantum entanglement.
        <br><br>
        
        Quantum entanglement is a complex phenomenon where particles' quantum states remain interconnected regardless of their spatial separation. This idea will be explored further in upcoming articles.
        <br><br>
        
        These contributions and discoveries collectively gave birth to quantum mechanics, laying the foundation for modern physics. This article offers a brief glimpse into the world of quantum. In future articles, we will delve deeper into these concepts in a more technical manner and explore topics like quantum computing, quantum teleportation, quantum machine learning, and algorithms.
